# Labyrinth: Create tiles for a landscape

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. Please add a new landscape.

Requirements:
- Download and install [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)
- Create tiles with the same dimensions as those which are there. Ways of his tile must end at the middle of the edges.
- Add the tiles to the labyrinth, so they are reachable. Please create a small portion of the labyrinth with them to make it more exciting. You may get inspiration from other parts of the labyinth.
- create a pull-request and have it merged and reviewed

Expected outcome:
- The tiles are added to the [tiles folder](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/tree/master/tiles/)
- An implementation of their behavior (how they can be entered and left, ...) is added to the [tiles file](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js).
- A small landscape with the tiles is part of the [larger labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth) and reachable.

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
