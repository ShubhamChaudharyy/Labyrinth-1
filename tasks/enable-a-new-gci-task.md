# Labyrinth: Enable a new GCI task

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
We have [a lot of tasks](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/tree/master/tasks) you can do.
However, some tasks are not posted to the system because there needs to be done some work before.
Help us post the new tasks!

Optional:
- Create a new GCI task in the [tasks directory](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/tree/master/tasks).

Requirements:
- Create an issue or find one for the task you want to enable.
- Ask what needs to be done to post the task (This should be a bullet list in the issue description).
- Create at least one pull request to resolve the issue.

Expected outcome:
- At least one pull request is merged
- The issue is resolved and a mentor agrees to post the task.
- All issues resulting from your pull-requests are resolved. This is important: You may create new issues and we tend to merge fast and allow several pull requests to be submitted for one issue

Hints:
- [Example Issue](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/issues/68)
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
