# Labyrinth: Improve the Code Quality

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. To keep the game easy to contribute in the future, please improve the code quality.

Requirements:
- Use a style checker for HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Create an issue with the errors you see in this file and a short description of what needs to be done to remove them.
- Make sure, you are assigned to the issue.
- Contribute at least 7 code improvements. Leave the code intact.

Expected Outcome:
- a merged pull request
- an issue which you are assigned to
- in the pull request, a link or text showing that the issues are resolved
- at least 7 solved code issues

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- Code checkers might be automatically running on this repository. You may use them or suggest others.
- Do not change generated files such as SVG files or generated CSS/HTML/JS files. Changing them is irrelevant as the mistakes reappear if we edit them with the generator.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
