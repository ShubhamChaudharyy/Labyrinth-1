# Labyrinth: Document how to contribute

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. Please make it easier to contribute by adding the necessary documentation.

Requirements:
- Add a new [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/issues) about which parts of the documentation you would like to contribute to and what the problem is.
- Discuss the issue
- Solve the issue alone or with others with one or more pull-requests.

Expected Outcome:
- Please post the link to the solved issue.
- There must be one commit in a pull request for this issue which is attributed to you.
- Make sure, you are assigned to work on this issue.

Hints:
- If the issue is too big, split it up in smaller parts.
- You must make a substantial contribution to the documentation, not just fixing a misspelling but fixing multiple misunderstandings or adding a new documented way to contribute. Please discuss whether this is a substantial contribution in the issue before you submit.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
