Tasks

These are the tasks for the GCI platform. Not all tasks may be reachable all the time.
If you wonder why, please open an issue or ask in the chat.

Guidelines for writing a task
-----------------------------

This should motivate what makes a good task and how to achieve it.

- Use the template of the previous tasks
- Add what the student should do in the requirements but let space for creativity.
- Add how you can test what the student did on the expected outcome.
  - Not testable: "good", "well", "proper", anything where you can have a discourse about without agreement.
    Those lead to power misuse and uncertainty.
  - Testable: closed issue + link, merged pull request + link, reachable functionality, commits, a file, code following documentation, a label
    - Everything is testable which is outside of you: "good" is your view. If a link is on github, both you and the student
      have the same access to that.
- Repetition:
  - If it can be done once and is completed, it is an issue, not a task
  - If it can be done endlessly, it is a task
  - If you mix both in a task, think about adding a task enablement issue.

Guidelines for review:
- The text counts, not the intention, so be precise in the text.
- If, as a mentor, you disagree about the outcome of a task and it is hard to explain, the task description can be improved.
  Set the instance count to 0. Please ask the students what you have in mind with the task and how you can better
  formulate this.
