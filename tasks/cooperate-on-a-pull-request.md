# Labyrinth: Cooperate on a Pull Request

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To train online cooperation, please cooperate on a pull request with an other student and solve an issue together.

Requirements:
- There is an [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/issues) which you want to solve
- You find an other person who likes to cooperate with you [in the chat](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth).
- Both you and the other person contribute to the pull request - at least one commit by you and the other person.

Expected Outcome:
- A merged pull request with at least two commits: one by you, one by another person (GCI or not): Post a link here
- We see that you and the other person agreed to cooperate: Post a link here of your agreement

Hints:
- You can either 
  - create a pull request to the branch of an other person and [compare across forks](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/compare)
  - or give the other person write access to your repository "Settings" -> "Collaborators and Teams"
- You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
