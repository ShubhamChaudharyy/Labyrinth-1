# Labyrinth: Solve an advanced Issue

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. Please improve the game by solving an advanced issue.

Requirements:
- Comment on an [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/labels/advanced) that you want to do it. If you have solved several tasks on this game before, you can not claim tasks that are too easy for you because we need them to give others an easy start.
- Create a pull request or something that resolves the issue which is tagged as GCI
- Get assigned to the issue you work on, so other people coordinate with you. Being assigned an issue does not mean you can block progress by not answering.

Expected outcome:
- The issue is resolved and has a label **advanced**, post a link to it so we can see you were the cause.
- All issues resulting from your pull-requests are resolved. This is important: You may create new issues and we tend to merge fast and allow several pull requests to be submitted for one issue

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
