### Description
<!-- Please describe which kind of music you like to add (length, style, ...). -->




### Implementation Plan
<!-- These are implementation hints that should help you complete the task.
     Please check them when you completed them and include the pull request link. -->

- [ ] Compose or play the music or sound and record it.
  - You can record sounds using [Audacity]
  - You can use [Sonic Pi] to program the sound.
- [ ] Add one file containing the song to the [/audio] folder.
- [ ] Add the license as a file according to [documentation]
- [ ] Add it to the API in the [tiles.js] file.

### Closing Criteria
<!-- When these criteria are met, we can close the issue. -->

- [ ] When we enter the tile, the music plays.
  - [ ] Check the browser console for errors.
  - [ ] Provide the way to the tile.
- The license of the music is
  - [ ] in the file next to the music so it belongs to the music file without doubt:
    same file name + `.license`

### Hints

- For your own recordings, we recommend choosing the license `CC-BY` or `CC-BY-SA` if you
  like others to remix or `CC-BY-ND` if you do not like people editing your song.
  Choose a license here: https://creativecommons.org/choose/
  Please do not choose NC as this might disable it for GSoC.
